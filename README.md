# Java Spring Labs

This repository contains practical labs and example projects developed with Java and Spring Boot. The goal is to explore different architectures, design patterns, security approaches, database integrations, and best practices in the Spring ecosystem.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into independent subprojects, each focusing on a specific approach or functionality:

| Project        | Description                                                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `jwt-auth`     | Implementation of authentication and authorization with JWT using Spring Security. |
| `hexagonal-api`| REST API built with Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters).           |
| `...`          | More projects will be added soon.                                        |

## ✅ Requirements

- Java 17+
- Maven or Gradle
- IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code
- Docker (optional, for databases and testing environments)

## 🚀 How to Run a Project

Each folder contains a complete Spring Boot project. To run any of them:

```bash
cd project-name
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
or with Gradle:
```bash
cd project-name
./gradlew bootRun
```
## 💡 Objectives
- Consolidate knowledge in backend development with Java and Spring.
- Create a reference base for study, interviews, and proof of concepts.
- Explore modern architecture and security patterns.
