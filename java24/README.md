# Java 24 Feature Demos

This project is a showcase of practical Java 24 features, designed to demonstrate enhancements that directly impact developers' daily work. 
From modern pattern matching to stream gatherers and scoped values, these examples reflect real-world usage in clean, minimal code.

> Inspired by real challenges faced by developers moving from Java 17/21 to Java 24.
